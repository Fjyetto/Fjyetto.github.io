				<em>What the hell Where are my guests gonna write some thing now</em>
				<p style="padding: 6px;">one of my first websites, <a href="https://dungeon52.neocities.org/">the dungeon 52 and 51 website</a>, featured a guestbook that any visitor could hop on and write anything they wanted and it was awesome</p>
				<h4>123Guestbook has shut down on July 1st 2024.</h4>
				<p>A free guestbook service that as of writing, has been up for a steady 18 years, now shutting down.<br>Heartbreaking...<br>This is pretty personal for me as it was part of my dungeon52 website which i cherish.</p>

				<h4>The tale of SMB1984...</h4>
				<p style="padding: 6px;">SMB1984 was a website born of boredom.<br>On April 17th 2023, during Computer Science class, I was browsing free website hosts.<br><br>I came across "000webhost". When I saw how sketchy the hosting service website itself was,<br>I was fueled with the energy to create SMB1984.<br>Of course I designed it during CS, made a quiz since that was our assignment. It was a quiz about Mario and 1984.<br><br>I also just used that website for anything and everything.<br><br>When I toyed with GamerMaker5, I had the only download for Cards of Destiny II be the floating install link on SMB1984.
				<br><br>When I did a bit of streaming, I had an idea, which was to put "redeemable" <span style="position:absolute;"><img class="expandable" src="/media/rw/1b637e29b7baf7ce51c280d46a504962.png"><img class="expandable" src="/media/rw/a451133caea600bf1c5348be08b16d50.png"><img class="expandable" src="/media/rw/c13367945d5d4c91047b3b50234aa7ab.png"></span><span style="width:54px; display:inline-block;"></span> codes on screen, you had to guess in chat<br>and when you found the code, you could go on SMB1984 and "redeem" it.
				<br>The only thing it did was just open a link from the hash of the code, where I would put an image with that link beforehand.<br>It fit because those streams mostly showed the spamton plushie, so of COURSE a sketchy website would be the place to put the redeemables.<br><br>Well, that's about all the website had. Now it's gone.<br>It looks like 000webhost doesn't actually host your website forever for free.<br>That makes sense. You can't profit like that.<br>I discovered it was gone on September 18th 2024, while browsing the big gunchus website.<br>I wanted to play the Mario 3D game, however, I was met with a page saying the website was archived.<br><img src="/media/sadmario.gif"><br>Well. I knew it would happen. That's why i backed up the website a while ago.<br>Still, it won't be as funny if there isn't "mariobros1984" in the URL and the host isn't blocked in my friends' countries.<br>Well, if you're here, thanks for reading.</p>
